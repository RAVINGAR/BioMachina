# !!! IMPORTANT NOTES !!!
# Custom models must follow the following rules! Otherwise the various animations applied to them will be extremely whack!
# For all given models, the overall pivot point must be positioned in the centre of the model. The pivot must also be
# placed at 8,8,8.
# To do this, select the root bone, click centre pivot (in most cases it
# will centre the pivot). Then with the root still selected MOVE the model (not the pivot) such that the pivot's location
# is as close to 8,8,8 as possible.
#
# If you wish for models to be orientated correctly, please ensure the front of the vehicle faces NORTH in block bench.
