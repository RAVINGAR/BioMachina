# !!! IMPORTANT NOTES !!!
# Custom models must follow the following rules! Otherwise the various animations applied to them will be extremely whack!
# For all given models, the overall pivot point must be positioned in the centre of the model. The pivot must also be
# placed at 8,8,8.
# To do this, select the root bone, click centre pivot (in most cases it
# will centre the pivot). Then with the root still selected MOVE the model (not the pivot) such that the pivot's location
# is as close to 8,8,8 as possible.
#
# If you wish for models to be orientated correctly, please ensure the front of the vehicle faces NORTH in block bench.
#
# Vehicle Types
#
# Motor Vehicle - 'motor_vehicle'
#   A motor vehicle is any such car, truck, bus or other vehicle that travels on land, and has wheels.
#
# Aircraft - 'aircraft'
#   An aircraft is any flying vehicle. It may start on the ground, but must reach a specific speed before it can take
#   off.
golf_cart: # Unique identifier
  type: motor_vehicle
  passenger_seats: 1
  chassis:
    # the path for the json file and texture file for this vehicle's chassis. this 'chassis' option is optional,
    # removing it will mean that the identifier of the vehicle is used as the path
    model: golf_cart
  wheels:
    # the path for the json file and texture file for this vehicle's wheel
    model: golf_cart_wheel
    # how many front wheels does this vehicle have. Front wheels will steer with the vehicle
    front_amount: 2
    # how many rear wheels does this vehicle have. Rear wheels will not steer
    rear_amount: 2
  stats:
    # This stat is in km/h. Please consider that a boat in water has a top speed of 28.8km/h, blue ice meanwhile has a
    # top speed of 261.82 km/h
    top_speed: 100
    # This stat is the increase in speed in kilometres per hour per second. For example, if this value was
    # 10.6, this means every second the speed of the vehicle will increase by 10.6 km/h.
    acceleration: 5.6
    # This stat controls how steep of a slope this given vehicle can ascend or descend.
    terrain_height: 1.0
    # The rate at which a vehicle can slow down. This is actually measured as km/h per second. (Opposite of acceleration)
    braking_power: 5.0
